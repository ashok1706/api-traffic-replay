## Making Changes

### Commit Messages

We follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/):

- `feat:` — New feature
- `fix:` — Bug fix
- `docs:` — Documentation only
- `test:` — Adding or updating tests
- `chore:` — Maintenance (deps, CI, config)
- `refactor:` — Code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature

Examples:
```
feat: add Redis storage adapter
fix: handle empty response body in diff engine
docs: add examples for CLI usage
```

### Pull Request Process

1. Ensure all tests pass (`npm test`)
2. Update documentation if your change affects the public API
3. Add tests for new functionality
4. Keep PRs focused — one feature or fix per PR
5. Fill out the PR template

### What We Look For

- **Tests**: All new code should have tests
- **Backwards compatibility**: Don't break existing APIs without discussion
- **Simplicity**: Prefer simple, readable code over clever solutions
- **Documentation**: Update README if you change public-facing behavior
